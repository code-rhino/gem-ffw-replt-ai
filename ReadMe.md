Here are the steps you need to take:

1. **Introduction to the AI Tool**: The transcript starts with an introduction to a cool AI tool inside Rept (a hypothetical platform for the context of this exercise) that assists with debugging.

2. **Identifying the Problem**: The speaker mentions issues with a webpage not rendering correctly, including images not showing up and other unspecified issues.

3. **Using the AI Debugging Tool**:
   - Click on the AI tool mentioned in the transcript. This will open a chat window similar to ChatGPT but integrated within Rept.
   - The AI tool suggests starting with specific questions or prompts to help diagnose the problem. In this case, the goal is to find bugs in the `index.html` file.

4. **Sending the Request to the AI**:
   - Use the prompt provided by the AI tool to find bugs in `index.html`.
   - Send this prompt to the AI for analysis.

5. **Reviewing the AI's Feedback and Making Corrections**:
   - **First Correction**: The AI points out that "met" should be changed to "meta" in the HTML code, indicating a missing "a" in the meta tags. Update the code accordingly.
   - **Second Correction**: Around line 9, the AI highlights a missing closing paragraph tag (`</p>`). Since the line numbers might not align perfectly, look for the paragraph that is missing its closing tag and add `</p>`.
   - **Third Correction**: The AI mentions a missing closing tag for an image. However, in HTML5, the `<img>` tag does not require a closing tag, so this might be a misunderstanding. The real issue as identified later is with the source attribute of the image tag.
   - **Fourth Correction**: Lastly, the AI points out an error with the source attribute of the image tag (`src`). The error was typing "SC" instead of "SRC". Correct this in the image tag.

6. **Final Steps**:
   - After making the corrections, rerun your HTML file or refresh your web view to check if the issues have been resolved.
   - If there's still a problem (like the image not showing up), revisit the AI tool for further debugging. In this scenario, the final step was to correct the source attribute for the image tag from "SC" to "SRC" to ensure the image displays correctly.

7. **Verification**: Refresh or rerun the web view to confirm that all issues have been resolved and the webpage is now rendering correctly.

### Corrected HTML Code

Here's how the corrected HTML code should look based on the transcript:

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph with a missing closing tag</p>
  <div>Here is a div with an <a href="www.example.com">example link</a></div>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image without a closing tag"> <!-- Corrected the source attribute -->

</body>
</html>
```

Note: The original mention of a missing closing tag for the image is a common misunderstanding since `<img>` tags in HTML5 are self-closing and do not require a separate closing tag. The real issue corrected was the typo in the `src` attribute.
